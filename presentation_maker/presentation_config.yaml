# Configuration file for creating presentation from rst files which contains
# Point-of-interest directives

# You need to fill presentation_start fields, images, first_slide and last_slide content.
# first_slide and other_slide has good default values so it is not mandatory to change these values.
# files fields are the most important fields in order to make presentation making to work.
# Those fields which are commented are using default values. Default values should work out of the box.
